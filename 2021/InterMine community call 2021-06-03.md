- What new features would you like to see the most?
    - More customisability without having to edit source files [#718](https://github.com/intermine/bluegenes/issues/718) +
        - could include reordering/removing existing pages and adding new ones
        - a guide which describes what we can add where (instead of an editor, we could write documentation to make it easier to edit source files)
    - Integrating BLAST service [#576](https://github.com/intermine/bluegenes/issues/576), Integration with a sequence server ++
        - seems to be widely used and integration/linkouts could be useful

        - and try to fix the issue related to multiple admins wich own different templates, they will no be public
    - List sharing (how many people use this?) [#652](https://github.com/intermine/bluegenes/issues/652)
        - some in wormmine could be using this - would be useful to add back
    - Improving im-tables used in BlueGenes
    - Improve experience when switching between mines (keep query/activity history for each mine, instead of clearing)
    - More features for list analysis [#572](https://github.com/intermine/bluegenes/issues/572) +
