     - Questions
         - Frictionless is involve machines and human, when describing data maybe better use the ontology term but also a more specific human readable descrption is fine

         - browser tools:
             - create datapackages: https://create.frictionlessdata.io/
             - validata data: http://try.goodtables.io/
 - InterMine SPARQL endpoint [Daniela]

     - SPARQL endpoint Demo
     - Questions
         - The code will be integrated as a new postprocess
         - The mapping should work for SimpleObject too, but it needs to be tested
         - federation queries with data providers using SPARQL endpoint (uniprot, disgenet)
         - this approach might bring new ideas, open new directions 
 - Outreachy December round [Rachel]
     - new user interface documention
     - update of existing intermine + bluegenes DEV documentation
 - GSoC - Deadlines: 29 Jan-19 Feb: Open source organizations applications

 - BlueGenes quick update [Kevin]
    - Quick overview of notable additions since last call
    - Introduction to configuring Bluegenes for your organisation's mines
    - [Flowchart for below](https://whimsical.com/bluegenes-deployment-QAYmWubSjSB1MH2gbHvSif)
    - Approaches to deployment of Bluegenes
	    - An instance for each organisation's mine
	    - One instance for all organisation's mines
    - How to allow an external Bluegenes to use visualization tools of a registry mine?
	    - Aim to deploy Bluegenes on the same domain as the mine(s)
		    - ex: `humanmine.org/humanmine/service` will point to the Intermine server, and any other path to Bluegenes
		    - An external Bluegenes will request `humanmine.org/api` (Bluegenes' backend) for its visualization tools
	    - Specify the URL of each mine's Bluegenes instance in the InterMine Registry
    - **Input from community is encouraged!**
