# Community Call Archives

InterMine community call archives (starting from October 2019, prior to this they were in Google Docs).

## Upcoming calls

Community calls are usually held quarterly, at 17:00 UK time. [Check when this is in your timezone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2019-10-03/17:00). All community calls are announced on [twitter](https://twitter.com/intermineorg) and [mailing list](https://lists.intermine.org/pipermail/dev/), and the upcoming dates are always shown on the [InterMine calendar](https://intermineorg.wordpress.com/events/).

## Archiving process
Call agendas are generated on HackMD, using the [InterMine call template](https://hackmd.io/Ba3xhPBuSOGgWBfj_pTKSg?edit). After the call, we export the markdown notes to this repository and make the original agenda read-only.
