        - Discussion started on [github](https://github.com/intermine/intermine/issues/2229)
        - What do we need in a core model:  
            - Cross-mine searches;  Sharing visualisations
            - Expression source; Sample; Value; Treatments (?)
            - Focus on RNA-seq;  Leave microarrays (2 sample)

        - No backward compatible
        - Most likely after BG release
        - we will continue the discussion on github
