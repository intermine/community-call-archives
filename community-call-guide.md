# InterMine Community Call Guide

{:toc}

## Before the call

### When planning the call
- Make sure you have [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) installed and up to date. 
    - You can try a [test call](https://zoom.us/test) if needed.
    - If you need to record or use breakout rooms, you can get the host key from KeyBase if you're an InterMine core team member. You don't need the username/password if you use the host key.  
- Set up a [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) document for the call and ensure it has "anyone can edit" rights. You can use this template: https://hackmd.io/@yoyehudi/SJkgHDJuH

### Call reminders

- If you can: try to send reminders one month, one week, one day, and one hour before the call. Include the notes and joining instructions
    - Email: InterMine dev list, dev at lists.intermine.org
    - Twitter - use [tweetdeck](tweetdeck.twitter.com/) to sign in, using the InterMine twitter credentials from KeyBase. You can schedule the tweets in advance. 

#### What to include in the reminder email

- A link to the notes for the call, 
- the time and timezone (this is especially important around clock change times) 
- A link to the Zoom room. 
- An indication about what type of audience may be interested and what topics will be discussed (e.g. "this is a techie call, and we'll be discussing X, Y, and Z")
- If there are guest speakers, make sure to mention their names and what they do. 

## During the call

### Reminders: 

Always give reminders at the start of the call: 

1. Remind people about the Code of conduct + how to report a violation if needed. 
    - make sure to mention a second contact who _isn't_ the call host, in case the call host is the person who caused the issue. The second contact doesn't have to be present in the call. 
2. Record the call! If people want their video off, they should switch if off before you start recording. 

### Questions/comments: 

- Some people may feel comfortable unmuting to ask questions or add comments, but also encourage people to use the chat or add notes in the agenda if they prefer - and don't forget to check for these comments!
- If there are guest speakers, remember to think up 1-2 questions or comments to ask them at the end, in case no-one else has any comments. 

### If there are breakout rooms:
Don't forget to pause the recording :) 

## After the call

1. Upload the recording to YouTube. Video processing usually takes a few hours, but once the video is processed (whether you recorded it on the cloud or to your local machine), you can upload it to the [InterMine YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXglYyAa0HQueHHxHWu9ERA). 
    - The login details for this channel are accessible to InterMine core team in Keybase. 
    - Use our [Google Slides Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1V8a-9H1RsX-dDZ9ut3sQcE4J51jWl2gSws1IO9Lt7wQ/edit?usp=sharing) to add a thumbnail. 
3. Save the call notes to [GitHub](https://github.com/intermine/community-call-archives)
4. Update the HackMD with links to the call archive and the video recording. (See [sample 'closed' HackMD call notes](https://hackmd.io/0dTj69n0QRi9Iwr8GZ8KCg?edit
))
5. Make the call notes read-only to the public if you can! 
6. Email your target audience with the notes, recording, and next call date.
